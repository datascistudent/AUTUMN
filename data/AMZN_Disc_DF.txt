12|on may 6, 2016|5.0 out of 5 stars|we love turbotax and have used it for at least 6 years.  it's user friendly, very easy to use and also very thorough.  it's saved us hundreds of dollars as we no longer have to use a cpa to have a complex taxes done.  we'll definitely buy it again and do highly recommend it.  way to go, turbotax!|easy, thorough, user-friendly and outstanding
13|on may 5, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|deceptive that the electronic filing of the first state was not included in the price.  wanted another $45 for the second state, but at least filled them out correctly.  they wanted another $90 to file the two states electronically.  so i would have rated them excellent if they weren't greedy and deceptive!|so i would have rated them excellent if they weren't greedy and deceptive

36|on may 1, 2016|4.0 out of 5 stars|i've been using turbotax for several years and find it very simple to use. it leads you through your taxes using a question-and-answer approach that provides help at each step if you're unsure how to answer.  in addition, if you find you need an upgraded version for a more complex tax situation it's easy to upgrade online directly through the program.  it's also easy and fast to file online. my only glitch was forgetting my password for the turbotax site when i went to pay for my state tax online filing!  you can also get a text to your smartphone when your return is accepted.  this is a very good program for those with basic tax needs.|if you find you need an upgraded version for a more complex tax situation it's easy to upgrade online directly through the progr

38|on april 30, 2016|5.0 out of 5 stars|have used turbotax for many, many years.  i'm glad they added back the features they took out of the program last year that caused so much negative feedback.  it's always been a great product for getting taxes done---again this year as well. fully satisfied; all went well; will order again. the deluxe edition does it for me. one note is that i don't have any significant stock holdings or investments, only retirement funds and iras. handles kids in college and always includes updates.|product does the trick; user-friendly and complete
39|on april 30, 2016|2.0 out of 5 stars|i have used turbotax for 25 years and been very pleased with it until the last two years. their decision last year to seriously reduce the program's scope and thereby significantly increase the price  caused me to seek other alternatives. i thought they saw the error of their ways and corrected it in this year's version. i discovered i was wrong when i filed my state income tax and was required to pay an additional fee for filing electronically by turbotax. they seem to be determined to charge excessively for their product. next year we will carefully shop for a product that is not excessively over priced!|... have used turbotax for 25 years and been very pleased with it until the last two years

42|on april 30, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|this review is about intuit's customer service. i called and ask which version (mac download) i would need to do a state by state comparison for retirement in regards to state income tax. i specifically ask if the software would be capable of performing this task with each state, it's laws, tax rates, etc. i was told to purchase the basic version and that when it updated, it would bring all state income tax laws current and allow me to compare. well, what do you know, it cost $44 dollars per state. maybe i'll get some unrealized payback from this review and it will be subtracted from their bottom line. seems now days one cannot double check businesses enough. update: i called and explained the situation to turbotax and they initiated a refund. the 3 stars is meant to represent a neutral review.|they fixed thier own blunder.

72|on april 27, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|not one of the easiest to use.  i've used other tax prep software in the past and wanted to try turbotax again.  the interview questions were not clear and required some searching to figure out what they were looking for.  perhaps i know too much about taxes since i answer tax prep questions for a living.  i had a hard time figuring out where to enter the information i knew had to be entered.  it was much better than doing taxes manually but took longer than i usually take do to the uncertainty of what was being asked.  perhaps it would have been a different story if i had not chosen the i know what i need to enter option. i did not go back and start over to choose that option to see if it would have been any clearer.|not the easiest to use.
73|on april 27, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|"turbotax made it very clear to me that the software purchased from amazon was quirky and had issues. they reloaded the same version for me.
            
            do they just want to sell it direct or was it really defective? they also don't tell you it doesn't include state filing on line or more than one state. you have to pay turbotax extra- twice what you paid for the software!
            
            amazon should make that clear to buyers- if they ever knew. i am not blaming amazon.  turbotax shouldn't sell a product that is defective and should have better transparency about the real filing costs."|turbotax really wants you to buy from them

77|on april 26, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|i have used turbotax for years but will not be using them again. when i went to do my taxes this year and after doing all of my federal return, the state would not load. i contacted turbotax customer service, and they couldn't get the state to load either. so they said i had to start all over, do my taxes online, enter everything manually and would have to pay an additional $95. unfortunately, i purchased my turbotax from amazon early, and by the time i did my taxes, it was beyond the return time so i was completely out of the money i spent on this package. i bought h&r block instead. federal and state downloaded onto my computer correctly in a matter of minutes.  it interfaced with my previous return and uploaded most of my information for my returns. they were done very quickly, and it only cost $55 , not the $95 that turbotax wanted to charge me to do my taxes online.|will not be buying turbotax again

87|on april 26, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|"for people filing as residents in a foreign country with both us and foreign income, this has the necessary forms but does not take into account the agreement between the us and certain countries regarding taxation of social security income, that it is taxable only in the country of residence.  i learned this (and how to enter the information) from the very helpful turbotax answerxchange.  (from irs publication 915: u.s. citizens residing abroad. u.s. citizens who are residents of the following countries are exempt from u.s. tax on their benefits. canada, egypt, germany, ireland, israel, italy (you must also be a citizen of italy for the ex-emption to apply), romania, united kingdom).
            
            another problem with this turbotax program is that it does not accept a foreign address when you try to pay to e-file a us state form.
            
            in the end the only advantage to the program was the easy filling in and printing of forms and being able to e-file the federal part, but i'm glad i bought it this year as i might not otherwise have searched the answerxchange and so quickly found the information.  last year i filed myself and was puzzled when the irs wrote that i'd made a mistake with the social security taxation and sent a refund, and i thought that buying this program would save me having to figure it out and would correct any related mistake."|for overseas filers not so advantageous

123|on april 22, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|i would normally give them a 4-5 star rating. first of all state filings are supposed to be $19.99. when submitting they jacked up both states to $24.99 even though the program stated $19.99 at the start of efiling. also since i filed after 4/18 which is not a problem if you don't owe anyone any money (fyi penalties and interest are based on owed money so if you don't owe money then there is no reason to file an extension), there was an update with a serious flaw in the program. anyone who filed before 4/20 probably wouldn't check there taxes. apparently one of the forms in the program was putting some sort of college scholarships or something into a return as taxable income when it shouldn't be. if you have college financial info in your return you better check the possible impact on this.|charge $5 more than advertised for efile of state returns, update on 4/20 has major impact on possible college scholarship info

            if you're filing from overseas in particular i'd really advise you to stay away from this. there are numerous issues filing from overseas that will cause problems. one immediate problem is the difficulty in getting someone on the line. their phone menu system is not too friendly for overseas numbers.
            
            another issue was the lack of transparency in the pricing. it was only at the end of the process that they tell you you have to pay an extra fee for them processing a credit card payment. mine rang up at almost $90 more just for processing it - that's in addition to the cost of the software package. what's worse is after multiple attempts of nearly completing the process i was informed that the state where i needed to file didn't accept overseas payments/addresses. in short, i've wasted a lot time and i'm now late filing.

            the software really does make doing your taxes much easier, especially when you import info from prior returns.  if it were as simple as that i'd give five stars.  i deducted two because every year you have to figure out how not to be duped by intuit's complex and obfuscated pricing."|e-file for state is $24.99 extra

            i bought despite the reviews only because this was the only software program for which i could find verified information online that handles the new affordable care act (obamacare) completely, and still allows for a deduction of these paid premiums for self employed health insurance deduction. and i can confirm this option is in the software with a slot to add the deduction. hr block's software failed miserably to allow this option last year (2014 return) so i went with turbotax (tt) this year.
            

            unfortunately, the tt install was less than smooth, took forever, and although the program did install and run, the interface is not as smooth as prior years nor as good as hr& block. also, it did import the hr block return from last year, but it left out lots of information - my vehicles, my home office measurements, deduction and details, and the usual stuff most tax software carries forward for business owners so you don't have to laboriously re-enter it. and i'm just getting started so there's bound to be more stuff the software just forgot to import. that alone is probably going to make me buy something else this weekend and get the return done before the deadline. what a hassle.
            

            a properly detailed prior-year import is important because often the irs ask questions like ""what was the date you put this vehicle in service?"" for business owners like me. well, every tax program i have been using the last 15 years imports all this stuff from the prior year, regardless of the software brand i used the prior year. ive tried every tax software out there. now turbotax is asking me to start over and put all this info about my vehicles in again. that means more work for me to have to go into my files and look up the exact date i put honda vehicle into service.
            

            this amounts to nothing more than sloppy programing on the part of intuit, the company that is supposed to be experts at this sort of thing.
            
            unless you have some glaring reason to use tt for this year's return, i'd say start with the others first.

            however, it's a real shame that this product charges so much extra for state e-file. to get around this, you have to print your state return(s) and snail mail them -- in 2016 this is an unnecessary waste of paper, postage, and time!
            

            now that my fed taxes have been filed, i received a letter from the irs saying i did not include the required form 8962 for my health insurance. this is despite filling out all of the information and entering my form 1095-a into turbotax. after searching, i found many other tt users have received this letter as well. there is a bug in the software, and the workaround requires deleting your healthcare worksheet and starting over with this section, then printing the missing forms and mailing to the irs. not fun at all."|it's great, except when it isn't

            following the instructions was ok until i got an error message that i did not enter a cell on my w2 correctly into the software. it was entered correctly and the software showed this as an error as last year the box had data in it. federal law had changed and now a new form is required if you have medical health care insurance from work. i had to leave the page for guided entry that i was working on and go find the new form in the software and check it. oddly enough the form was there and filled out correctly and now the error message had disappeared on its own.
            

            i then found out that i could not return to the location in the software that i had been working on. i wasted a hour of time trying to find the right spot to continue entering data again using the guided preparation method. this should be easier to return back to the same location but i just didn’t know how to do it.

212|on april 10, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|"last year, after intuit's disgusting money grab, i used h&r block.  although block was ultimately successful for me, navigation was difficult and would have resulted in higher taxes had i not known tax law better and found how to get the correct result from the program.  not really trusting intuit, despising their recent actions, but longing for the years when tax preparation with tt was convenient, easy and accurate, i decided to try tt deluxe this year.
            

            i'm very disappointed for three reasons: (but see my correction for (1) below)
            
            (1) despite assurances that ""all"" the forms are there, i've found out the hard way that they're not.  irs guidance for reporting short sales has changed for 2015.  in my case, call options against stock are sold, then bought back at a later time, constituting a 'short sale'.  irs specifically requires form 8849, ""sales and other dispositions of capital assets"" to be filed for such short sales before these transactions can flow to schedule d.  from intuit's web page, ""form 8849 is a claim for refund of excise taxes.  it is not part of an income tax return and is not supported by turbotax.""  the workaround is to download the form from the irs, complete manually and file by mail.  infuriating.
            

            i'm editing my above complaint after discovering that turbotax automatically generates form 8849, but it is inaccessible for editing.  i imported stock trades using .txf files with sales dates before purchase dates just as i have in years past, ignoring directions from my brokerage firm & deciding to ignore the need to file 8849.  these transactions flowed to schedule d as usual, but surprisingly, the program then automatically generated the required form 8849 (viewable in the ""forms in my return"" display)!  so even though tt web page claimed that 8849 doesn't belong in a tax return, tt put it in, found no errors, and i can efile.  so, i'm pleased that all will work out, but unhappy that i had to struggle to get here ...
            

            (2) last year, h&r block imported all my previous financial institution details (such as names and addresses of dividend and interest payers), but turbotax did not return the favor this year.  i have to enter all of them again manually.
            

            (3) incessant promotional 'upgrade' advertisements that serve only to irritate.  does intuit really think these are likely to get them more business?
            

            on the plus side, tt properly handled business k-1 forms, something that h&r block doesn't (information from my business partner)
            

            in summary,  turbotax. isn't all that bad ...  if there is no ""screw the customer"" attempt next year, i'll buy it again."|missing form 8849 (actually not, but quite a hassle ...)

            i have a mac, and the only option is to transfer using .pdf file - essentially the print out of the fed tax form.  my turbo tax software is the ""home & business"" version.  i was unsuccessful initially with the transfer.  called tech support and didn't get much of any help, other than saying my .pdf file is corrupted, which is not true.
            

            the pdf file is really just a printout of your tax form.  if i can open it and print it, it is not corrupted.  essentially with the transfer turbo tax will attempt to read the pdf file as tax forms and process the information.  it may failed due to certain forms it does not support.  so, you can try printing minimal forms and increase the forms try to get the maximum information imported.
            

            i tried printing different forms into the pdf file, and this is what i found out:
            
            1.  import is unsuccessful if pdf file contains the complete return, including mini-worksheets and cover page.
            
            2.  import is successful if the pdf file contains only the first page of my 1040 form - a summary of my tax information.
            
            3.  import is successful if the pdf contains fedral ""entire return, including forms to submit""

            btw: if you spent more than 15 minutes trying but failed to import, you should give up.  the transfer of information is minimal, not worth the time and frustration/stress over this.  it'll take you no more than 15 minutes to input the information anyways."|writing this review to help those who needed to transfer ...
255|on april 3, 2016|2.0 out of 5 stars|"disclaimer: i've only used it for basic income (including stocks and options) and deductions - no schedule c, property, or schedule k partnerships.
            
            allows entry via q&a, and also by direct entry via worksheets and forms (but see below)
            
            pros: does the job, accommodates download of stock transactions, provides, a bit clumsily, electronic filing capability, and
            
            intuit provides a bit better than average help via q&a and via telephone.
            
            room for improvement:
            
            if entries are made via q&a, changing entries proves a challenge. intuit does not provide a flow chart to help you identify which worksheets or forms you need to access first to make changes.
            
            it would not be at all difficult to provide a flow chart on the turbotax web site. one star off.
            
            upstream navigation would be simpler if there were some positive indication that a field or check box contains the initial entry.
            
            the magnifying glass on right click on a field indicates that the initial entry is upstream - that is helpful. the plus sign on right click indicates initial entry with possible underlying detail in a note sheet. no icon on right click may - or may not - indicate an initial entry. if it's not the intial entry, right click (always/somtimes?) brings up a menu that includes ""data source,"" and choosing that item usually clues you into an upstream entry. bit awkward. for example, on the (state) tax payment worksheet, right click on line 6 (state overpayment) brings up a note telling you the entry comes from line 6 on the (federal) tax payment worksheet, and the right click on the latter tells you that it comes from the carryover worksheet, and that's the end, with no indication as to whether the carryover worksheet is the initial source.
            
            turbotax assumes that prior year state tax overpayment is the same as amount applied to current year, and requires a manual work around if not (see federal carryover worksheet, columns (f) and (g)). i think. very confusing.
            
            electronic filing - two stars off. not at all clear whether you have enabled payment of tax due automatic withdrawal for federal and for state. you can find out - possibly - by opening ""filing instructions,"" but the information there may be inconsistent with entries you see on form 1040. for example, instructions say ""you have elected to pay your balance due . . . by direct debit using the following information . . . .,"" but form 1040 shows all xxxxxs in the routing fields.  preview for printing 1040 shows all xxxxs. suppose you choose to file electronically, with direct debit, and then find out it didn't work and you need to mail in payment. 20 mm in blood pressure and 2 stars off for that one.
            
            not at all clear which boxes you need to check to enable or disable direct debit.

260|on april 2, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|"beware!!! i bought turbo tax to do my daughters return.  i am an educated person, so i figured this shouldn't be a big deal to use.  boy, was i wrong.
            
            first of all, it only allows you to file 1 state return.  my daughter worked a summer job in mi which has reciprocity with il.  (i now know all about that, but i didn't last summer)  the software tells you that you don't need to file a return because of the reciprocity.  i understand that, but because mi state tax was withheld i need to file a nonresident return to mi to get her money back.  there is the biggest issue i had, that took hours to solve, was getting all the money back paid to mi.  i had a cpa friend review the return and he kept assuring me it was wrong.  i googled for help and all i could find was people having the same issue.  finally in the software i searched the right word combo to see what was wrong.  do not file a non resident tax return without searching in the software how to file a non resident return.  there is wording in the software which will make you lose out on money you are due back.  next issue.
            

            the software wants to charge you $44.95 to file your second state tax form.  i opted to go online and file my own tax return for free in 10 min.  it is straight forward.  i would have spent less time and energy filling out the forms myself rather than trying to figure out how to get the software to work correctly.
            

            as a first time user, i found this to be a huge disappointment.  i can only imagine how many people are losing out on money they are truly due back to them.  with the cost of the software and the extra dollars i almost lost out on, i could have hired someone to do the taxes.
            

            funny thing was, my cpa friend tried to get the software to do the tax return correctly and he couldn't either."|non resident tax filers, beware!!!!

            last but not least--it wants to sell you the audit protection very hard. every time you go through review before filing, you get multiple ""opportunities"" to buy audit defense.

            but... this year i found a flaw! a huge flaw! working in one state while living in another. to further complicate it.. the ""work in state (tn)"" does not collect income tax. while the ""live/filing state (al)"" does.. employer doesn't collect so w2 is blank.. turbotax didn't catch it.. rejected by state.. long story short.. after several days, spent hours on hold with tt help, & 2 more state rejections, it was fixed by trial & error. keep in mind you pay to efile state. & on the deluxe edition,  you get one state.. tt wanted to collect another fee for state of tn $39 & filing fee $20.. so $59 to file in a state that doesn't tax income.. last resort was paper file & ugh.. who wants that..
            
            so, the 100% guarantee for errors is a very inaccurate statement.

697|on march 3, 2016|4.0 out of 5 stars|"summary: intuit put the forms back, and now it works great for my situation (w2, assorted 109x forms, and schedule c).
            

            i had used turbotax for many years up until last year, when they pulled some vital forms from their deluxe version.  i needed schedule c, and i didn't see the point of having to pay so much extra to get that functionality when there were other options out there.  so i switched to h&r block's tax software.  it worked okay, but i learned the difference between software written by a software company (intuit) vs software written by a tax processing company (h&r block).
            

            so when intuit announced they had put the schedule c form functionality back into deluxe this year, i figured i'd try them again.  and hooray, everything i needed was there, and i was able to do my taxes with ease.  turbotax is still miles ahead of the other do-it-yourself tax packages.  much easier to use, more user-friendly, and it gives me a more confident feeling that i'm not missing anything.
            

            there are other, cheaper options out there for tax software, but i personally believe turbotax really is the best.  as long as they keep the current functionality in the deluxe version, i doubt i'll ever use any other tax prep software."|the forms are back, and so am i

774|on march 1, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|disappointed with product.  i successfully downloaded it to my windows 7 computer.  i had it all done and saved.  the next time i went to retrieve it - it would not open.  had to put disk back in and make repair.  thought it was all set and my final attempt to review it, i could not open again.  had to repair again and download patch.  i decided to finalize it and email taxes to irs before i lost it again.  i didn't want to take a chance with efiling state return so i mailed it in.  a lot of work that should have been easy.  all said, my taxes were accepted by irs quickly & received refund within a week. hope the program doesn't do this to me next year.  i have been using turbotax for many years and this is the first year i had problems like this.|disappointed

778|on march 1, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|i have purchased turbotax for many many years and have never had any issues. however this year when i purchased this software program the forms were not yet available for filing when i tried to file my state taxes. this was very frustrating because i had to make several phone calls before i finally contacted someone from turbotax and they informed me that the forms would not be available until march 5. this is very discouraging because in my opinion software should not be sold to customers if the forms are not ready to be filed. i live in louisiana and i checked with our state department of revenue and they informed me that their state forms were ready for filing and that the problem was with the actual software. amazon decided to send me a free replacement copy of the software but unfortunately that is not helping me since i still have to wait before i can file my state taxes. in my opinion turbotax or amazon should refund me the purchase price of this software for my inconvenience. because of this inconvenience now i have to wait several weeks before i can file my state taxes which means my refund will also be delayed several weeks. amazon explained that this software has been available since november. that makes no sense to me for them to sell a product that is not ready to be used. and then to charge me for this product that was not ready is really ridiculous.|unhappy with turbotax software

785|on march 1, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|"it is poor software. unfortunately i cannot get it (turbotax deluxe software mac version) to import from ameritrade and wells fargo. i used h&r block for 2014, which couldn't import the data either. the 2013 turbotax online version (premiere) was able to import the data but it was buggy...very slow and frequently crashed. i'm not sure whether this (the ability to import data) is a problem just with the software rather than online version or whether it is deluxe versus premiere version. i changed back to turbotax to get the import feature. i'm disappointed. should have stuck with h&r block.
            

            btw: it does a very poor job of importing previous year tax info from h&r block. the only thing it successfully imported from that tax return was our names, address, occupation, dob, ss#. it couldn't import any tax information"|i'm disappointed. should have stuck with h&r block

794|on march 1, 2016|4.0 out of 5 stars|i have used turbotax for years, since they acquired macintax.  one year i did try h&r block, but that was a mistake.  the reason for the downgrade was that i needed form 8949 and it wasn't included in turbotax deluxe.  i would have needed to upgrade to turbotax premier for this one form.  i downloaded the pdf version of the form from the irs website completed it and manually entered the information on my 1040.  turbotax didn't like that and kept reminding me when i ran an error check.|no form 8949

796|on march 1, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|turbotax is ok, but they insist on having donatoins on-line instead as a part of their program, presumably so they can more eassily sell your informatoin.  i also do not trust turbotax's data security.  look for someone filing your taxes and collecting yur refund next year.  caveat emptor.|turbotax is only ok at best

798|on march 1, 2016|4.0 out of 5 stars|after some more research, it appears that the state filing (illinois) difficulty is due to the fact that my state asks a series of authentication questions to cut back on fraudulent returns.  still very confusing, but not the fault of turbotax.  also, it appears that acquiring a state pin would alleviate some of these authentication questions.  help options on turbotax remain, at least to me, somewhat cumbersome.|update.

1025|on february 21, 2016|5.0 out of 5 stars|"those who remember having to fill out paper tax forms and doing the math on their own can appreciate a program like turbotax. it walks you through what you need to enter, figures out the math, then fills out the appropriate forms for you. depending on your payroll administrator, it will even import your w-2 for you.
            

            a word of advice when purchasing turbotax is to make sure you get the right product. i choose deluxe federal + state since i live in a state (new york) that requires a state return. if i only purchased deluxe federal or basic, i would have had to pay extra for the state return (something i learned my first year). unfortunately, turbotax often shoots itself in the foot with misleading promotions like the ""free"" online federal return it's been touting. do the research and you'll find that it's only ""free"" for certain people in certain situations. there's always a catch. i've found it's just been easier to buy the physical cd each year. i don't have to pay anything extra beyond the purchase price since there are no e-filing fees (luckily, new york is the only state that doesn't require them). once again, doing research before you buy will ensure you don't get surprised by unexpected expenses or choosing a product that doesn't offer everything you need it to.

1072|on february 20, 2016|2.0 out of 5 stars|"i have used turbo tax for 8 years and never had an issue with it until this year (tax year 2015), but this year it was an extremely frustrating experience.  i'm not sure i will ever use it again.
            

            as far as i can tell, i think the final numbers are accurate, but turbo tax 2015 has such an obtuse approach it is very difficult to check.  for example,
            
            some standard terms i am familiar with for decades have a different meaning in tt2015fed tax:
            
            - turbo taxes number for fed tax withheld does not match my w2s and 1099rs, its several hundred more.  what!!!
            
            - i used the tt2015 taxable income in the irs tax worksheet calculations (a very simple calc at that point) and came up with several hundred dollars less than t2015.  turns out there are extra taxes over $200k that are probably included in the tt2015 numbers, but because tt doesn't mention that i spend many hours figuring it out.  there are so many useless steps, it wouldn't hurt for them to put that step in.
            
            - hsa deductions spent on medical expenses are not supposed to be taxed, but tt 2015 shows them as taxable income.  it doesn't tax them but shows them as taxable in the summary.  took me more hours to figure that out..  many comments on line about this.
            

            tt2015 hides many things from you, which keep you from understanding how they come up with the numbers, which as far as i can tell are actually correct, but it leads you to believe they are in error until you spend a lot of time digging into it.
            
            i get the impression they think we are too stupid to be shown these things.
            
            i became so frustrated and went through so many iterations i almost decided to dump tt2015 and do my taxes manually.
            
            had i started out that way it would have taken less time.
            
            no thanks for eating up so much of my time, intuit."|turbo tax 2015 took more time than manual tax prep.

            - had problems installing. would not get past a certain point, then it would stall. finally got it installed after 7 times trying.
            

            - then, once installed, it locked up on the screen that says ""ok we know it's taking a little more than a moment"". how appropriate.
            

            - after several times of task manager close-out of program, it finally got out of the ""wait one moment screen"" and onto the update screen. update just sat there for 15-20 minutes, but the program say update will take less than a minute. never got it to update. cannot get past the update screen.
            

            this years version is a piece of junk. i wish intuit would have tested this product before shoving it down the customers throat without checking. please read the reviews and pay attention. all these people are not lying.

            next year i'm going back to something else; just too many fees no matter which version you buy; i'd prefer to either have the software free and pay the fees or buy the software and have everything included; but i'm sure intuit knows that once people get the the e-filing section they are already too deep in to cancel.
            

            the software itself is good however; although some help items point you in the wrong direction as they haven't been updated. specifically when filling in stocks that are missing cost basis and other fields; the help says to select the ""additional information"" button; but it is not listed as that anymore; instead it is called something relating to employer epp plans or similar. once figuring that out the stock handling was fairly easy; but since my taxes will be much simpler next year; i'm moving on as it's just not worth the nickle and diming."|good software but misleading fee structure

1374|on february 6, 2016|5.0 out of 5 stars|i've used turbo tax for many years and find it to be the best product on the market. i used to use tax cut but it degenerated as a program once h&r block got hold of it.|does the trick
1375|on february 6, 2016|4.0 out of 5 stars|"i've tried both major tax software packages (this and h&r block's) as well as the turbotax online version. while none of them is perfect, i think this is the best of the three. what sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. you even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. this flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. i find that i generally go direct to things i've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when i first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). if you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-g, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.
            

            they don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with premier and home business. it's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. they can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. the main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.
            

            my recommendation is that you save some money and start with deluxe or basic. if you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. the software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. my guess is that you won't ever have to, however."|not perfect, but the best tax software of the three options i've tried

            i'm using the 2015 tax year cd for pc that i bought from amazon on a windows 7 machine. everything installed correctly and it updated itself. i prepared my taxes just as always as my tax returns never really change from year to year. i always efile federal and state. i realize that turbotax charges extra for state filing.
            

            but when i actually tried to efile, i was unable to connect to the turbotax secure server. the window comes up telling you to 'click continue to connect to our secure server'. when i do that, nothing happens. nothing. so i shut it down and tried again. nothing.
            

            so i went to the turbotax support page to look for a solution. whoever designed this page wasn't interested in providing solutions, there is no search function. instead, its a chronological list of tax questions with no answers about program support. after wading through this for two hours i finally found a way to submit a trouble ticket and was provided an 800 number to call for support.
            

            so i called turbotax support for the first time in my life. big mistake. i was on hold for another two hours and when my call was finally answered and i described the problem, i was put on hold again while the rep 'talked to the computer people' about the problem. 20 minutes later, he returned to say it was a known problem and that they were 'working on it'. he offered to send me an email describing the problem and a solution set.
            

            when i got the email, the link took me back to a topic on the original help webpage i had already read for two hours and had rejected as not really a solution to my problem. further, it hadn't been updated in a week and there was no solution posted.
            

            so here i sit with junk software i already paid for, unable to efile and non returnable, waiting for somebody to email me about a solution that really isnt my problem.

            02/05/16 ok, i gave turbo tax on more chance.  based on the thought that i possibly had a bad disk i spent another $39 and bought a new disk from amazon.  same issue.  it's impossible to talk to customer service without a 45 minute wait. using information i got from my first (bad) experience i went to turbotax.com and did a download from the website.  still no joy.  the program asked me to delete the ""old"" version which i did, but then it would only download to 21%.  there are just too many people having serious issues for this to be passed off as ""your computer is bad"".  and what's up with the wait times on your customer service?  if you know you're having problems why not staff up to meet the call volume?  i am now officially done with turbotax.  i spent close to $100 (for two disks) with nothing to show for it.  if i could rate turbotax with no stars i would do so."|poor customer service and support

            when it crashes, you have to force it to close, and it then it asks if you want to save the file. initially i said no, i did not want to. same problems as before when trying to start a return. eventually i tried saying yes to saving the file. no joy. it crashed when it tried to load the file.

            i don't know what the problem is with this software other than it obviously has not been adequately tested.
            

            update: it appears that this software is simply not compatible with zoomtext 10.1. zoomtext is a program to magnify the screen for those of us who do not have perfect vision. i would think that this program would at least check compatibility with resident programs. i don't know if they didn't bother to check to see if someone else was using something they were wanting to use, or if they just didn't care.
            

            update 2: the ""solution"" offered by the manufacturer rep trent below is useless. that is like asking me to take off my glasses until i am actually using turbotax. you can actually see turbotax causing a launch of zoomtext at times. which results in all kinds of weird behavior. you would think that a company like intuit would try to at least comply with assistive software (ever hear of ada?) this should have been picked up in testing long ago, and if it was, then there should be a clear disclaimer that it doesn't work with assistive software. the mere fact that the software is causing the interference with other programs is absurd."|not ready for prime time.

1660|on january 26, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|why can't they just leave things alone? after last year's fiasco, you would think that they would make things consumer friendly again. i have used turbo tax for a number of years now and until the deluxe/premier confusion of a year ago,i was always satisfied with this product. intuit did make good on its debacle of last year, but now i have just encountered a new dilemma for my return using this year's deluxe version. until i attempted to complete my new york state return, i did not realize that the 2015 deluxe comes in two different versions, one that includes state taxes and one that does not. i do not ever recall seeing a deluxe version in year's past that did not include at least one state filing with the initial purchase. maybe i got lucky and selected the correct version for each of past several years because i was always able to file my state taxes using turbo tax deluxe, but i find it most outrageous that it costs $39.99 to add the state tax feature to the version that i purchased this year when i could have paid an additional $9.86 to have it already included in the federal + state version. the list price for the 2 versions of deluxe has only a $10.00 difference, which certainly raises the question as to why intuit would feel it is justified to charge an additional $39.99 for this feature other than to take advantage of their own customers. very sad and very disappointing way of doing business.|i was always satisfied with this product

1705|on january 26, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|"(26jan2016) i am completing this review as solicited by turbotax via email. please keep in mind that i have not completed my taxes this year yet because i am still waiting for 1099 from my broker. i'm mostly basing my this review on my experience from previous versions of the product. i may return to update this review after completing my returns this year.
            

            pros:
            
            * very easy to use
            
            * electronically submit federal and state returns
            
            * no drm
            
            * up to date forms/instructions
            
            * this robot is likely less expensive than hiring a meat cpa to do your taxes
            

            cons:
            
            * sends very many emails upon registering
            
            * stealth fee for electronically submitting state returns (add about $20 to the price tag to do this)
            
            * doesn't handle all capital gains (selling stocks/bonds or property) without an upgrade
            

            other thoughts:
            
            when i was younger, i remember watching my father complete his taxes using the instructions and forms that he picked up in the library. there's no reason that people should really *need* a product like this. it is said by some political pundits that the tax code is made specifically complex to obfuscate the whole process. lobbyists from tax preparation services are said to keep completing annual tax returns difficult on purpose to protect their industry. intuit, and their employees have made sizable campaign contributions to officials from both political parties and pacs."|i'll tell you what i think about turbotax deluxe 2015

1743|on january 26, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|maybe even three and a half.  it is certainly a great, great help versus simply typing out the forms on your own, and i filed my 2015 taxes already in part because this makes it so easy.  however, it can be a bit opaque as to the significance of certain more specific items.  in my case, although it had me enter the $5000 dependent care flex spending account allocation from my 2015 w-2, it did not ask me any questions about dependent care expenses.  had i not deliberately hunted for a way to get it to ask me those questions -- ultimately, by plodding through the empty exercise of computing a childcare tax credit for which i knew i was not eligible -- it would not have asked me about those expenses and i'd be $2000 poorer.  i then realized that this had probably happened last year as well, and i reviewed my last year's return to find that i should have gotten about $2000 more back.  now i'm glad to have some unexpected money coming in, but i should have had that money last year.  i would think that dependent care flex spending accounts are common enough that the questions could be asked outside the context of computing a tax credit that many people know they cannot take -- especially when your w-2 entry reflects that you had such an account.  the reason i missed it in 2014, and almost missed it this year, is that i just skipped the childcare credit and assumed zero for that, and i thought the program had already accounted for the tax savings of the flex account.  because this non-credit topic is buried within the childcare credit topic instead of parallel to it, people who know they can't get the credit may not get the right questions asked.  yes, ultimately i got the right result, but it was more confusing than it had to be.  i will still use it again, and take it as a lesson that one can't abandon all effort on one's taxes -- the program is a helpful aid but not a perfect one.|pretty good, but a little imprecise at times

            but what they will not explicitly confirm is whether the forms are only available for manual data entry or whether it actually is integrated, with worksheets, etc.  if the former, it is no better than picking up the paper forms at the library or the irs website.

            now intuit needs to think about their user experience.  much has already been written about the great missing form fiasco of 2014.  the forms appear to be back in 2015 (your mileage may vary), but the application continues its propensity for up-selling.  but wait, that's not all.
            

            upon installation the software announced that it needed to download a number of updates.  that makes sense, brand new software needs patches, and we all know the irs and congress love to muck with tax regulations on a semi-daily basis.  the issue is with the way the updates are delivered.  as turbotax its update process, windows puts up a ""user account control"" dialog asking for permission.  the file asking for permission, is an unsigned msi installer with a gibberish name.  nothing that immediately identifies it as genuine intuit software.  seriously?  in today's world of malware and viruses this is unacceptable.  think about how easy it would be for some rogue software to masquerade as a turbo tax update...

1876|on january 18, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|"i have been using turbo tax for well over a decade. obviously, even if it wasn't perfect before i've been a satisfied customer. i'm writing a review to warn folks about how badly degraded the programming of this application has become for tax year 2015.
            

            perhaps most important, it is no longer possible to revisit a sequence of questions previously answered to change one's response/s! some screens can be revisited, but with other crucial screens you have to start over from scratch to see the screen again. yes, there are still section summaries with update buttons, but clicking update does not correctly change all the flags that have been set behind the scenes, so some past screens can be revisited but other important screens cannot. let me give an example from early in the program.
            

            suppose you got a state tax refund the previous year. the first time through reporting income tt asks if you want to see if the refund is taxable. you select yes, and you are asked to specify something about the previous year's tax form (even if tt has access to your 2014 data). you are shown two radio buttons (the kind where one and only one _must_ be selected). the first is labeled ""line 5a is checked,"" the second ""line 5b is checked."" but form 1040 for 2014 has no lines 5a or 5b. (neither does form 1040 for 2015.)  it has a line 5 which you check only if you are a widow(er). say you're not a widow(er). because it uses radio buttons (and only two options) tt still requires you to say that some line 5 is checked. huh?
            

            so you try to go back and start the sequence again in case you missed something. in previous years this was no problem. but this year unless you start a new tax return from scratch, you will never again have access to the screen that asks if you want to see if the refund is taxable. this is less than professional software design and it represents a major degradation from previous years.
            

            another example also related to faulty update buttons. when you import your previous year's tt file, it brings over your previous w2s, but -- probably also because of faulty flags set behind the scenes -- it will not allow you to enter new data into those w2s. you have to delete them and start new w2s from scratch. this is the first edition of tt i've encountered with such a  problem. because of the issues with importing previous-year tt files, i see little if any advantage to using tt instead of switching to a competently programmed tax application.
            

            i'm a career programmer myself, and i can't recall seeing such an unfinished app released to the public since the early 1990s. given the consistent higher quality of tt over numerous past years this is as curious as it is frustrating. makes one wonder if expanding horizons have changed intuit's focus so much that they no longer really care about their software."|surprising decline in quality for the tax app i've always used

1879|on january 17, 2016|3.0 out of 5 stars|"after feeling burn like many others from last year’s tt debacle, i was tempted to go away after many years of using from tt and go with something else but after hearing that the functionality of the deluxe edition was going to be the same as what i had prior to 2014, i decided to stick with tt for 2015 and hope that what is promised holds true.  like the old expression, deal with the devil you know versus the one you don’t.  over the years i have had a love/hate relationship with tt, specifically how intuit does business with their software.  besides playing games with the deluxe software last year which forced you to go to a more expensive version, i think they intentionally create confusion with their multiple versions.  each year though you have to purchase the new year’s version at a higher price than last year with this year having no real promotions or incentives to buy as opposed to previous years.  you would think that with last year’s issues, intuit would really work hard to get its customer base back.
            

            with each new version of tt, you have to suffer through the bugs that each year’s version brings.  last year’s version brought 45 updates.  this year’s tt’s updates are already up to twelve as of the time i write this review.  i can appreciate form updates but you would think that the program issues would have been worked out long ago.  i normally have to wait for filing a few weeks into the new year before i file, but it does concern me they are still issuing program updates all the way through april.
            

            in addition to the upfront cost of the software purchase, intuit adds the additional cost of e-filing with the state which they carefully put in the fine print. if you have to add a second state, then that is an additional cost as well.
            

            for the most part, the software interface is basically the same and hasn’t changed much from year to year, and even with my complaints about intuit, i like the way the software walks you through the different things to help you finish the taxes pretty accurately.  it is quick, easy, and i haven’t had any issues with the software doing my taxes.  it does look like the functionality i am use to in previous years is in this version.  i had no issues installing on my windows 7 computer.  even though the software is pricey, it is cheaper than going to a tax preparer, especially if you have to file for something other than the ez form.
            

            i used turbo tax for years and even with my complaints, i have been mostly satisfied with prior versions of tt deluxe each year but i can’t highly rate especially when i feel intuit plays games with its consumers.

            last year, i attempted to contact intuit several times because, even though they said they'd provide all the schedules as in previous years, their web site description didn't reflect that. i never received a reply so i went with h&r, which i don't particularly like. this year, they have one last chance to make good.

1897|on january 15, 2016|1.0 out of 5 stars|"software development companies have review/focus groups that have the task of monetizing the company's products and one of the more disturbing techniques they employ is called upselling. the idea is rather simple: you buy a product only to discover that it doesn't provide features that you thought were included and in this case, you cannot finish your tax return. intuit's market research team has ascertained that taxpayers are at best, confused by the 100,000 pages of irs codes and no one knows all the forms and worksheets they will need to file. which is why we turn to companies like intuit in the first place. intuit is exploiting this lack of understanding to force customers to pay for upgraded packages when virtually none of the features are needed. in 2014, i was required to pay a $40 upgrade fee to file a single 1099-b with a net vaue of $25.
            
            if you make a mistake and need to upgrade: 1- have to completely delete the deluxe version and to be honest this isn't easy;  2- you must then pay intuit an upgrade fee to upgrade to the premier package which is probably going to cost you more than buying the premier package to begin with; 3- you will then need to install premier and from what can be ascertained on searches users are experiencing difficulties with this; 4- you must start over on the return.
            
            to be clear: faced with this situation, a taxpayer should be able to obtain the missing form from the irs, manually complete it and then add the values to his/her return. intuit will not let you do this. you will not be able to complete your tax return without the upgrade.
            
            before you buy an intuit product ask yourself this: do you realistically already know every form you will be required to submit? intuit is betting you don't know and they have structured their products to take advantage of this."|buyer be warned: intuit is upselling its products to unsuspecting customers

            i, too, jumped ship from tt last year after about 15 years with them due to their business practices. . i used h&r and everything went very smoothly. h&r imported my tt 2013 data efficiently and accurately. i filed and a few months later, my state sent me a bill for additional tax and penalty saying i made an error. i checked my filing and sure enough, the h&r software had entered a deduction twice, lowering my income and tax liability. i tried for three months to get h&r to respond but other than the initial email acknowledging my inquiry, they never would respond to any further request even though they have a guaranty. i was going to file a bbb complaint but figured it would be worthless.
            
            so this year, i went back to tt and ordered tt deluxe from amazon. it arrived today and when i attempted to import the h&r info, i got the same error message everyone has been complaining about. i used their call in support and it said there was a 5 minute wait. i followed their instructions and called the special number they sent to me. a recorded message said essentially to save my time waiting they would call me back. of course, they never did. it was during their normal working hours, too. i waited an hour (still within their working hours) got the same ""we'll call you back"" story but it is now another hour and they never called back. btw, they don't let you wait on line. they kick you out supposedly telling you they will call you back. so, based on reading all the other one star responders, intuit continues to suck but i will not go back to h&r. i will try again tomorrow but i am sure i will have to reload every account again and spend time i haven't had to spend since the first time about 15 years ago. if i ever get someone to talk to, i will ask if i can import my tt data from 2013. my accounts don't change significantly from one year to another. i'm sure tt 2015 can use tt 2013 data. i'll change my rating if i am successful.
            

            update 2-25-16  after writing this review in january, we headed for florida and just returned 2-21-16. i had not been previously successful in importing the h&r block t14 file to tt. so on 2-23, i called in to tech support again. this time i was successful because i have an intuit account which allowed me to sign in. reaching a tech person was almost instantaneous. this person was extremely nice and pretty knowledgeable. she was located in the washington state tech center. she explained that the tt software had been rewritten to allow for the t14 import. she even had the bulletin #sln63369 describing the problem and the solution.however, after an hour of working with me, we were not able to accomplish that result. she then said she would transfer me to a higher level of support. i waited on hold for about another half hour without success, so i finally hung up. on 2-24, i called in again and did reach a tech support person very quickly. she was in the arizona.tech center. unfortunately, she had no idea of what i was talking about.but i patiently described the problem and gave her the bulletin reference. this time, when i soon realized we weren't getting anywhere, i asked for a supervisor. about 10 minutes on hold, a supervisor was on the phone but she, too, didn't have a clue. i then suggested that if i could import the tt 2013 file and skip the h&r 2014, i would get back most of my information. she said the original tech person could help me with that. i complained but she transferred me anyway. of course the original tech support person had no idea how to do that and i finally got fed up. i asked that person if some technically competent person at a higher level from intuit could call me back. however, she said she would try but they usually don't do that. it is now another day later and no call. i am now re-inputting all my data from scratch just as i would as a first time user. have to admit, tech support did give me about 3 hours of their time to no avail. very bad indeed!!! still one star.
            
            however, i can't go back to h&r block because their software made an error that cost me money last year and h&r doesn't care about their customers. they won't honor their guarantee. h&r didn't respond to my complaint after repeated follow ups. also, very bad indeed!!!!"|non responsive to problems-importing h&r

1931|on january 11, 2016|4.0 out of 5 stars|"this is okay tax-prep software with some annoying behavior, but it'll get the job done.
            

            i used the online version of turbotax for many years and was very happy with it.  but when i got married, my husband took over doing the taxes, and he used other tax programs.  having now used both, he strongly prefers the h&r block program.  i'm not sure i would go with that, but this does point out how different users have different expectations and preferences.  i think h&r block is more straightforward and no-nonsense, and turbotax is better for people who like to have their hand held a little more.
            

            a few points that might be worth noting:
            

            *  turbotax now has added the functionality to import data if you did your taxes last year with h&r block.  this was a huge concern for my husband, but now it seems to be working.  be sure to do a software update after installing.  and keep in mind that it will only import last year's file.  if you need to import data from previous years (yes, that happens sometimes), you're out of luck.
            
            *  only one state tax download is included, and it will automatically default to the state of the first return you prepare.  since my husband does his mother's taxes for her, and she lives out of state, this might not have been the option we wanted to use.  this probably won't come up for a lot of people, but if you are one of them (planning to do tax returns involving multiple states), look into this before you begin and maybe decide which state it would be most advantageous for you to get for free.  there might be a way to change the default, but my husband hasn't come across it.
            
            *  the refund it says you are due is absolutely going to change throughout your preparation.  don't get excited in the beginning when it says you are due a big refund.  turbotax makes this announcement before it has enough information to know what it's talking about or even to have made a reasonable estimate.
            

            in general, i like the layout and environment of the current turbotax, but my husband hates it.  he feels like it jumps around too much during the ""interview,"" and he hates how it's a little too full of itself, constantly calling attention to its accomplishments (""we found you a deduction!"") that are nothing more than what you should expect (it would be almost criminal if any tax software *didn't* do the things turbotax congratulates itself on).  i didn't think much of this, but once my husband pointed it out, i did start find it really annoying.  when a tax program is that proud of itself, it actually loses some credibility.
            

            my biggest problem with turbotax is that they seem to have fallen into the practice of making their software as limited as possible to open possibilities for them to force you to upgrade, or to make you feel tied to their programs.  this is designed to increase their profits, of course, and that's not unreasonable (to an extent), but the end result is that they have blown their trustworthiness with formerly loyal customers.
            

            update:  my husband did get the h&r block program for comparison, and he loved returning to the more streamlined interview that h&r block provides.  in turbotax, if there are ten related questions, chances are, each one will be on a separate page.  in contrast, h&r block lumps them together on one page, and you go down with radio buttons and check off any that apply to you (which will then bring up the relevant follow-up questions), which seems to make the whole thing much quicker.  my husband just hates sitting through page after page of having to check ""no,"" ""no,"" no,"" for things that don't apply to us (actually, i think most things default to ""no,"" but you still have to go through one page at a time for many topics that hrb lumps together).  but he still says that for anyone who feels a little uncomfortable doing their own taxes, turbotax is probably the best way to go (but it's still my preference, and i feel comfortable doing my taxes).  once he put in final figures, both programs came up with exactly the same refund, so it doesn't appear that one program is better than the other at maximizing your refund."|turbotax vs. h&r block

            old review: at first i was also frustrated that there seemed to be no way to import my 2014 taxcut data into turbotax 2015 for mac, and it also would not recognize my tt’2013 data, however i was finally successful using the following method:
            

            1. open last year’s “filename.t14” in taxcut and select “save as pdf” from the file menu.
            

            2. in turbotax, select the pdf file named “filename_for_filing.pdf” (in the same folder as the original “filename.t14” file) and click import.
            

            it worked fine, and now i have all of last year’s data in tt’15, and everything appears correct so far. i am reserving one star (in consideration of last year's antics) until i am farther along on my taxes, especially after i see how it handles schedule c. if proves to be as good as in previous years i expect to upgrade this to a 5-star review."|import from taxcut 2014 not so much on a mac...

            turbotax always keeps a record of the prior years taxes.  and you can easily refer to that info.
            

            another good thing is that turbotax prompts you to search for deductions, to reduce your tax bill.  they offer suggestions that normally, you would think of.  this easy to understand, and turbo tax reviews all your entries, checks for errors.  and, it makes sure that you are not submitting a return with mistakes.
            

            you have the option of e-filing your federal tax which is not cost.  but for your state, you can e-file for a low cost.  plus,  it also keeps up with all updates, so you know you are getting help, including on-line professional help.

            in a related issue, if they could ever fix the sort problem, i want them to also keep the page positioned where it was when i edited a particular item. for example if i have the 23rd item of 40 at the top of my current view, after i click edit on #25 and return, i want to come back with either #23 or #25 at the top of my view. instead, it goes back to #1 and of course, that's #1 fifo, not #1 based on the sort i applied. again, a real pia to the user and a very simple change to list processing for the intuit programmers to correct this!"|please fix list processing!!!
2003|on december 30, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars|i like turbotax and have used it for years. i had two problems with this year's version. first, although i indicated i had used turbotax to file last year's return this year's version did not pull any information in from last year's return and i had to rekey that information. i track my state and federal taxes throughout the year and feel fairly confident that i am correct on both. i then use turbotax to confirm my calculations and prepare my federal and state returns. my second issue with this year's turbotax came after i had loaded everything and confirmed that my federal calculation was correct to include the health care piece. the next day when i opened turbotax my modest federal refund had become a significant tax owed. i identified the problem as the health insurance piece was now blank and said to be unavailable thus creating the liability. the health care piece was there one day and gone the next. it has since reappeared and the turbotax calculation once again confirmed my own calculation.|i like turbotax and have used it for years

2006|on december 30, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars|"i have downgraded turbo tax from five stars to four stars because they no longer include a free e-file for state taxes. other than that it is still a great product. the other fix turbo tax should aim for in 2016 is to maintain the position to which you have scrolled on a page. when you are working your way down a page and you select a topic to open up and work on you are returned to the top of the page when you return so you must repeatedly scroll down to get to each successive topic.

            this summary re-places an earlier *place-holder* review when i didn’t have sufficient information from financial institutions and other forms to complete our return.
            

            the install of the program was straightforward, as one would expect. it took about 30 minutes, including several online federal and state “updates” and “form” downloads.  one note – more often than not, every time i opened the program thereafter it prompted me for updates. it was a little frustrating to wait before starting work, but worthwhile i guess to be fully current.
            

            turbotax imported my previous year’s return without issue from taxact.
            

            having never used turbotax before, as my prep i went through my 2015 records, summarized data and recorded calculations into copied federal forms, assuming i might just re-enter the figures as prompted by the software, as i did with the previous year’s program. mistake! turbotax has its own protocol, and i found myself tossing my summaries aside, digging back into my collected records and entering raw data for the program itself to process/summarize. in some cases, this proved cumbersome. for example, a portion of a pension i receive is non-taxable, and i’ve done the calculations manually for several years, so i have the formula down. unfortunately, turbotax wouldn’t accept my bottom-line figure – it needed to go through the process step by step, a laborious method. again – frustrating, but i guess beneficial in that it takes human error out of the equation.
            

            the other cumbersome aspect i found is its’ lack of flexibility for certain accounts.  in entering total volunteer expenses for mileage, e.g., the program assumes *one* departure point and *one* destination. despite meticulous record-keeping, turbotax wouldn’t accept a cumulative mileage figure that encompassed different trips to different locations for one organization. it would have been very helpful to export our records from excel.
            

            another shortcoming is a lack of explanation for various line items or forms.  some required entries do not have any clarification, and requesting “help” sends you to a forum with answers populated by other users.  i found myself often toggling between the open return, the help forum and the irs web site.
            

            i did love the ability of turbotax to access and import data from external sources. for example, it was able to grab tax data from vanguard to plug in dividend and other information.  great time-saving feature.  going through every section step by step also allows you to review whether you’ve missed either a requirement or an opportunity to reduce your liability.
            

            i used turbotax for our state return as well.  i found it very quick, after completing our federal return.  although the state return software component was free, intuit did charge $19.99 to e-file the state return."|comprehensive and thorough - but tailor your prep for it

            turbotax deluxe is a great choice for those with fairly simple taxes who want to file on their own.  when i first started using turbotax i was a bit worried that it would somehow screw my taxes up, or that it would be hard to use.  however, since i started using it, i've had no reason to use anything else.  the first time i used it i still lived at home with my parents and filled out a 1040ez form.  now i am married, own a home, and have a spouse in college and turbotax continues to be accurate and easy to use.
            

            turbotax will guide you through all of your income sources (w-2, 1099 int, rentals, social security, etc.) and your deductions (mortgage interest, college expenses, property taxes, donations, etc.) and prompt you for each type of form and what figure is in each box on the form.  it will also ask you questions about your situation to see if certain programs or credits apply.  it's pretty much foolproof.  while you're filling in the information your applicable tax refund or payment will appear in a box on the left.  the numbers change as you add more data, so it's easy to see where things are headed.
            

            if you'd prefer a more hands-on approach you can choose income sources and deductions on your own, skipping the prompted entries to save some time.  additionally, copies of all of the tax forms are included with the software, so if you really want to be hands-on you could fill them in manually (although i'm not sure why you would want to).
            

            the nice thing about the deluxe edition is that it includes one state return as well.  if you have to file in two states (as we do), you'll have to pay $19.99 extra for each additional state.  you make your payment through the computer, the new state's forms are downloaded instantly, and you can continue with your tax return in a matter of minutes.
            

            when your taxes are complete you can e-file them using turbotax as well.  before they get submitted the software will check for errors/audit risks, and you have the option of printing out a copy for your records.  once they are submitted electronically, you'll receive a confirmation e-mail from turbotax letting you know that they were successfully received.
            

            one nice feature of turbotax is that if you used it to process your previous year's taxes it can import all of your personal data over (names, social security numbers, etc.).
            

            i installed the software on my macbook air by sharing the optical drive on my imac.  my macbook air is running os x 10.11.1 and i had no issues or glitches.

            i've been using a turbo tax for years on windows and most recently on mac in the past few years. a number of years i tried other tax software, but felt it wasn't as comprehensive as turbo tax. i also tried tax services, which charged an arm and a leg for basically filling out a turbo tax-style form.
            

            bottom line, turbo tax is still the best tax software out on the market, especially after learning from their errors in the past."|still the best tax software in the market, especially after correcting the schedule c&d issues

2051|on december 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars|"i've been using turbotax for at least 15 years.  i've consistently used the deluxe version, and have done both federal and state taxes.  turbotax has been incredibly helpful to me.  i haven't always liked the answers, but i do feel like i get reliable information and calculations.
            

            i imagine that my fondness for turbotax is due in part to the fact that i am now used to how they organize the software, and i know what to expect.  there are two ways to access your entries:
            

            - interview mode:  this walks you through each section of your taxes by topic, and you answer a series of questions and enter data.  that's generally how i enter and edit most of the information.
            

            - forms mode:  you can directly edit the forms, by using forms mode.  there have been times when i have found this necessary to get the information right.  this takes a higher level of comfort with the software and your knowledge of the forms, but it's a useful feature that i'm not sure everyone knows about.
            

            import last year's results:  one of the most useful features to me is the ability to import last year's results.  it's a great time saver.  the only issue is that, as far as i know, if you amend a return you cannot re-import the results and edit a later year's taxes.
            

            do the software updates:  remember that the irs can and sometimes will change the forms up until the end of the tax year.  turbotax has to update their software after that.  so remember to run the updates regularly.  i typically wait until february or later to finalize my taxes, to make sure the software is updated.  in particular, don't draw conclusions about the software until turbotax has had time to fully update it.  updates are easy to install.
            

            save the software updates:  if you purchased a cd version, you can download and save the updates for each year so that you can re-install the software if you think you'll need to use it on another computer, or want to leave that option open.  (although turbotax keeps the updates online for at least a few years, you may want to save them for a longer time.)
            

            online account:  any software you purchase through turbotax will show up as a download in your online account, some of mine go back 10 years.  that's a nice feature.
            

            luckily for me when i last bought turbotax in early 2014, turbotax had already walked back their policy on the changes to what was included in this edition.  their customer service immediately upgraded me to the new edition, so it was easy for me and left a positive impression about their customer service.
            

            update:  it's april 2016.  i've had zero issues with turbotax.  it has been a great tool for me."|turbotax makes the unpleasant job of doing taxes much quicker and easier
2052|on december 10, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars|"last year (2014), turbotax deluxe got slammed with bad reviews. this was mainly due to the schedules c, d, and e forms that intuit removed and forced people to upgrade to the more expensive premier to get them back. basically, these forms were for people who are self-employed, independent contractors, have non-investment capital gains or losses, or own real estate that was rented out to tenants.
            

            intuit claimed the removal of the forms wasn’t to force deluxe customers to upgrade to premier, but to synchronize the desktop version with the online version. regardless, customers viewed it as a bait and switch prompting over a thousand 1-star ratings on amazon. if that wasn’t enough, turbotax stopped transmitting state returns for a time due to fraud concerns; criminals using stolen identity information to hijack refunds. the company tried to make up for all this by sending out several apology letters and offering free upgrades and rebates, but the damage was still done.
            

            this year, thankfully intuit learned their lesson. they brought back schedules c, d, and e to the turbotax deluxe version. according to intuit’s website, the online version of deluxe only supports schedule c (not d or e), but the download/cd version supports all three. a quick glance at the vendor’s product image on amazon also confirms all three (c, d, and e). if that wasn’t enough, i checked the software by going to forms > open form and expanding the list. schedules c, d, and e all came up. whew!
            

            as for myself, i didn’t need any of those forms in 2014, so it wasn’t a problem for me. i have been using turbotax since 2005 because it makes doing taxes much easier than printing and filling out forms manually. sure, the direct-to-forms method is free, but turbotax not only makes it easier and quicker, but it helps prevent mistakes (which could be way more costly down the line). i love how information is retained from the previous year and easily inserts into the new one. work at the same place as 2014? you don’t have to mess around with retyping the 10 digit employer id or the mailing address (that is assuming you used turbotax in 2014).
            

            2014 data is transferred and easily comes up for reinsertion. the layout and process is nearly identical: same personal summary, refund amount status, information wizard, etc. -- there’s even the same blue bar design at the top of the screen.
            

            the health insurance section was a little more detailed with the addition of the 1095 forms. since i was laid off in 2015, i had to switch insurance around thus had several of these forms. i also ended up not being covered for two months. thankfully i was below the three month no-insurance period and avoided any penalty. turbotax made entering all this information fairly easy.
            

            i was a little disappointed that the amazon gift card offer was removed this year. last year, i took advantage of allocating part of my refund so that i would get the benefit of amazon’s additional credit. not so for 2015 :-(
            

            regardless, e-filing my federal forms worked easily with the option of adding both me and my wife’s driver license information to help prevent someone else submitting taxes under our name. i skipped e-filing the state because turbotax wanted to charge an extra $20 -- federal is free, but state isn’t for some reason. so i printed off the forms instead and took them to the post office (usps). it cost me $0.93 to mail my state and another $0.49 to mail my property taxes. much better than $20, although it will be slower than e-filing.
            

            overall, for me, i find that turbotax helps to minimize the annoyance of this yearly cumbersome task, and i plan on continuing to use it for the years to come."|the forms removed from last year are back and the software works as it did before

2060|on december 6, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars|"last year's turbotax software received an avalanche of criticisms and overwhelmingly negative reviews after the folks at intuit decided to remove several features that they believed were not being fully utilized by a majority of their consumer base. at the same time, the price of the product went up. as it turned out, this was a pretty horrendous move on their part, and it didn't take them long to pull an about-face and make some changes. previous turbotax software users left the program in droves - with most turning, instead, to h & r block's home product. (i was one of those people.)

2062|on december 5, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars|"last year, after reviewing the changes that intuit had made in turbotax, i felt (after over 12 years of continuing, satisfied use) that it was changed in ways that no longer suited my needs. for the first (and now last!) time, i went with taxcut. it failed to ask all the necessary questions and, as a result, i wound up owing a substantial tax payment to the feds. no one could be as happy as i am to discover that the previous versions had been updated and restored in this program for 2015.
            

            i think that my experience speaks both to the nature of large businesses (who often feel that they know better than the consumers who buy their products) and too the responsiveness of this particular company, intuit, to the loss of business and thousands of customer complaints. i welcome the turbotax program i had come to trust back.

2063|on december 5, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars|"ok, like many long time users of turbo tax, last year was a very bad year for me.  the company messed up and they admitted it.  so, i decided to give them a chance to see if they had fixed their problems.  here is what i found:
            

            1.  first, i had moved from a windows 8.1 machine to a mac simply because i hated what happened to windows and version 10 did not impress me.  so, i was apprehensive about how turbo tax would work on my mac.  i am happy to say that it loaded without any issues and if found my imported form from last year.
            

            2.  do not know if it is just the mac, but turbo tax updated quickly this year and also loaded quickly.  it was able to load last years information without problems and i was up and running within no time (7 minutes from the time i loaded the software till the time it had updated itself, found my last years file, and was ready for input for this year).
            

            3.  so far, i have not found any problems with either the step by step method of data entry (here, the program presumes you know nothing and guides you through the process) or with the direct data entry method (you go to forms view and enter everything on your own).
            

            4.  there are still forms pending, which is not unusual for this time of year and i do not have all of forms in yet either.  but, with what i have been able to do and what i have seen, this product appears to be back to the dependable form that it was prior to last year.
            

            while it is a bit early yet to give a final review (i will continue to update this review as warranted), it appears that the folks at intuit figured out their mistakes and have learned from it.  they have gone back to delivering a product that is useful, helpful, and adequate for most filings.  as i have already mentioned, i am using a mac with os x el capitan, which is their latest release.  i have not tried this on microsoft software, so cannot comment on that.  however, based on my experience with os x, i would recommend this software once again."|turbotax deluxe 2015 federal + state taxes
2064|on december 4, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars|"i have used turbotax for many years and i think it's a very good software product.  so, i'm primarily rating the software - it is generally a very user friendly product for walking a filer through the extremely complex u.s. tax code.  there are a few places where i've struggled with the prompts or options for submitting data (amortizing bond premium is one they've improved over time), but, considering everything involved, it's pretty darn good.  i have to review this before i'll have any tax forms, so there's a limited amount i can reasonably do to be timely here.
            

            i do have some issues with things the company's management has done over time.  their infamous marketing screwup last year where they tried to force a lot of users to buy a higher cost version by dropping some pretty basic forms from deluxe really blew up on them and they were deservedly lambasted for it until they started reversing it - although not before they pushed a lot of users to competitors as you'll note if you read reviews here.  there's just no excuse for that kind of management decision - if you want to raise the price, raise it and live with the results.  still, and remarkably, i notice that the packaging for this disk shows you have to buy premier to handle stock sales!  i'm pretty certain you don't, as confirmed by other reviews here.  they've had a long time to correct this and they've had a big incentive to do so, so what in the world is wrong with them?  as forrest gump might say ""stupid is as stupid does"" or something like that.
            

            additionally, intuit has been really slow to adopt more security measures to protect users against tax filing identity theft.  this year i believe they are finally taking some steps and i applaud that, but what took you so long?  another act that shows a lack of focus on customer satisfaction and well being.  again, management not equal to the technical people."|good software.  packaging and management issues.

            i expect a few things from tax software:
            

            1. it should be complete and functional when it hits the shelf.
            
            2. the price should be reasonable.
            
            3. it should work well with common operating systems.
            
            4. it should automatically update as tax laws and forms change.
            
            5. it should import last years’ information and analyze it with this year’s information to help maximize deductions and carry forward investment data.
            
            6. it should be accurate and find all available deductions.
            
            7. less important, but nice to have, is importing from quicken, intuit’s buggy and intermittently inaccurate financial program.
            

            intuit screwed up last year by removing forms from deluxe that have been a part of that level for years. why? to force people to pay more for one of their higher-priced products. that was enough for some of us to try out h&r block software and discover that it is just as good for less money.
            

            this year i’m testing out deluxe again and already i’m seeing the typical intuit lackadaisical attitude toward software development. case in point: the data from 2014 h&r block is not transferring as promised and it no longer works with win xp (just because windows doesn’t want to support xp doesn’t mean intuit should drop it). since i bought this for a mac, the xp thing doesn’t affect me directly, but i know of many people who still use xp who will be switching to h&r block this year. already intuit has violated my #1, 2, 3, & 5 requirements and i haven’t even completed my taxes.

2076|on november 29, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars|turbotax screwed up big time last year when they silently deleted 1040 schedules c and d from turbotax deluxe. this burned a lot of their old customers that relied on these schedules (popular with part-time workers and retired people as well as small business owners). a lot of their customers (including me) jumped ship to h&r block, which offers very similar software for a lower price and with schedules c & d included. turbotax restored these schedules in the 2015 edition and they promise to seamlessly import h&r block tax returns, but apparently this is not working yet. i gave them 1 star last year for burning me. i'll give them 2 more stars this year (3 total) because they restored schedules c & d and are promising to get h&r block importing to work eventually (but you're not going to fool me twice).|schedules c & d are back, but h&r block importing does not work (yet?)

            turbotax online support indicates this is a known problem. fine, but since this the first thing that many people want to do with this software, it indicates that intuit is doing zero user testing on their product before shipping it. i wonder what else is broken.
            

            update: intuit released a fix as of december 10, 2015. it still does not work on my return. a ""wait"" message with a spinner has been added, and the failure message is different, so they did do something. i tried it on my daughter's very simple federal return and it did import, though i have not checked for accuracy or completeness.

            you really can't go wrong with this.  i know some people switched to block last year, but we tried block once before, and intuit still has the edge here in usability.  i especially like that state taxes are easier this year.  previously we've had to go through extra steps to do our state return, but it was largely transparent this year, with the program simply asking what state we lived in and then showing the results.

2084|on november 24, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars|"i had great experiences with turbo tax in the past, including 2013. then in 2014 they changed the format completely (deleting the vast majority of forms, saying you have to buy them a la carte or some nonsense like that). wtf turbo tax? i mean seriously??
            

            this year (2015), most forms are back, and they're back to a somewhat familiar format. but you have to poke around a little bit to find certain things like schedule c. in other words, they make it intentionally difficult, and make it much easier if you buy the home & business version.
            

            for deluxe, i think $50 is a bit steep, but this version does come with fed, state, and deduction manager.
            

            the basic does not have the audit alert (*shame* on you turbo tax, that's a dirty trick, all versions should have red flags). to me, that's a deal killer for the  makes the basic almost unusable. i don't think anybody should submit a form that doesn't have a risk meter or red flag. that's why i can't give this 5-stars.
            

            but this is the #1 selling, and #1 rated, tax software. i've also tried and liked h&r block (but i haven't seen their 2015 yet). i personally am sticking with one of those two brands.
            

            and two other tips for tax software:
            

            first, get the physical cd-rom over the download or web based. it's more secure, you're more likely to catch a sale price, you can install multiple accounts on multiple computers, and there are several other advantages.
            

            second, do not e-file. i know this sounds radical and inconvenient. most people think the free e-file is a perk.
            

            however, efiling is one of the things that puts you into a pool for a randomized audit. so does filing early, and using the return envelope the irs provides (with a bar code on it). instead, print your taxes, mail them in an old fashioned envelope with stamp.
            

            good luck!"|yes deluxe does have schedule c. basic version is worthless, don't bother. turbo tax is good software, but they are tricksters

2088|on november 23, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars|"among the first steps taken by tax filers is the transfer of data from last years return.  turbotax ads and its software claim it can transfer files from other tax preparation software.  i used h&r block last year due to well know problems with tt deluxe limited tax forms. i returned to tt deluxe this year because those forms have been restored for the 2015 filing year.  unfortunately the data transfer would not work.
            
            the message i received from the tt help site was:
            
            ""h&r block data transfer error:  some turbotax customers are experiencing an issue with their h&r block data transfer.
            
            workaround: unfortunately we will be unable to provide a resolution to this issue this year.  if you are unable to transfer due to an error you may enter the information manually. turbotax transfers your name, social security number and address. we do not currently transfer any financial information. we apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused you.""
            
            now we all know that the transfer of data is much more than name, ss#, and address.  it includes filing status, names of all prior year 1099's, other prior year income sources, prior year charitable contributions names, prior year itemized deductions names (when using supporting details).  the transfer serves as the roadmap providing continuity with your prior year's filing giving guidance of what to look for in the current year (new income/expense items that only started in the current tax year always require manual entry or downloads when available).  tt comments seem to trivialize this critical component of using tax software in their above response.  what is missing is information on what is being done to fix this.
            
            it seems that this is false advertising.  the transfer capability is in their ads and on their software boxes and in their software.  turbo tax please respond to this concern.  i wasted hours looking for solutions before finally getting the faq response cited above. please fix the problem. don't ignore it as the faq suggests."|turbotax data transfers from h&r block do not work.

2090|on november 17, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars|"addendum: just figured out this is spyware. reduced to one star, would be zero if i could. just tried to print an estimated tax payment form from 2014 turbotax deluxe. my computer (a mac) was not connected to the internet at the time. this is a ""stand-alone"" program on my computer. it would not print unless i connected to the internet so the program could contact ""intuit's secure print service"". so i connected, but then intuit also wanted to ""update"" the program. then, of course, it would not be the same program that figured my taxes last year. so lock your program and return after you file.
            
            what about 2015 turbotax deluxe? i opened the program and opened a new return, totally blank. tried to print the blank forms, but the same deal. couldn't even print blank forms without ""permission"" from intuit. so this program is  worthless if you don't have the internet. also, what else are they taking from, or planting on, your computer without your knowledge?
            
            an internet search shows they have included spyware before (2003), and i recall they retained social security numbers without permission last year in addition to dropping forms from turbotax deluxe 2014.
